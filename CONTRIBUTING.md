# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional documentation, I greatly value feedback and contributions from the developer community.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure I have all the necessary information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.

## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

I welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.

When filing an issue, please check existing open, or recently closed, issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

- A reproducible test case or series of steps
- The version of the code being used
- Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
- Anything unusual about your environment or deployment
- Screenshots or logs if applicable

## Contributing via Pull Requests

Contributions via pull requests are much appreciated! Before sending a pull request, please ensure that:

1. You are working against the latest source on the _main_ branch.
2. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
3. You open an issue to discuss any significant work - I would hate for your time to be wasted.

To send a pull request, please:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Modify the source; please focus on the specific change you are contributing. If you also reformat all the code, it will be hard for me to focus on your change.
3. Ensure local tests pass (if applicable).
4. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages.
5. Send a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface.
6. Stay involved in the conversation and respond to feedback promptly.

GitHub provides additional documentation on [forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

## Finding Contributions to Work On

Looking at the existing issues is a great way to find something to contribute to. I use GitHub issue labels (enhancement/bug/duplicate/help wanted/invalid/question/wontfix), so looking at any 'help wanted' issues is a great place to start.
